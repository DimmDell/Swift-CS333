#Assignments

###Assignment #1: Toying with Swift
Implement mechanics of the board game of your choice:
* [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)
* [Draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts)
* [Corners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugolki)
* [Nard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nard_(game))
* [Rummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummy)
* [Durak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak)
* [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game))
* [...](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamecategory)

_There are hundreds of thousands of different games out there. No duplicates please._

Your program should produce basic game log:
```
    Black: Pawn E3 E4
    White: Knight D3 E5
    Checkmate
    White Wins!
```
There is no need to implement complex AI, use random or greedy strategy.

You can port your game from (CS253)[http://edu.mmcs.sfedu.ru/course/view.php?id=57] to Swift as this assignment.

The result should be a playground file that prints game session log.
Every class should be implemented in its own file.
