###Assignment #1: Toying with Swift
Implement mechanics of the board game of your choice:
* (Chess)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess]
* (Draughts)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts]
* (Corners)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugolki]
* (Nard)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nard_(game)]
* (Rummy)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummy]
* (Durak)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak]
* (Monopoly)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)]
* (...)[http://boardgamegeek.com/]

_There should not be more than one implementation of the same game mechanics_

*Remember that this is just one of your assignments!

Do not pick a game with to many (or too little) moving parts!*
Your program should produce basic game log:
    Black: Pawn E3 E4
    White: Knight D3 E5
    Checkmate
    White Wins!

There is no need to implement complex AI, random or maximizing strategy is enough.

You can port your task from CS252 to swift as this assignment.
